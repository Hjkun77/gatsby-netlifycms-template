    The Student Organizations Assessment and Review (SOAR) is the management,
    evaluation, and accreditation system for all registered student groups and
    organizations in the Loyola Schools. SOAR aims to provide a more formative
    approach to monitoring the growth and development and overall performance of
    student organizations through the integration of both quantitative and
    qualitative measures. SOAR is also the primary basis for accreditation of
    student organizations in the Loyola Schools.
